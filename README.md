[DESCRIPTION]

    Program 1 (a4q1a_int.c):
        takes input from a file and creates and prints an integer linked list

    Program 2 (a4q1a_char.c):
        takes input from a file and creates and prints a character linked list

    program 3 (a4q1b.c):
        does not completely work, only map works (hoping for part marks on this)
        

[USAGE]

    a4q1a_int:
    make a4q1a_int
    ./a4q1a_int.out [filename]

    a4q1a_char:
    make a4q1a_char
    ./a4q1a_char.out [filename]

    a4q1b:
    make a4q1b
    ./a4q1b.out
    ***NOTE***
    this function does not work, only outputs the test that I used to test
    the map function, if this doesnt help my grade PLEASE ignore it
